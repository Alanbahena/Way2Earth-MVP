# Way2Earth-MVP
First MVP with essential features working.


This was my first full stack iOS project. 🧑🏻‍🔬
An application that allows people to create environmental postive impacts. 

The first MVP was created in Xcode with Swift and SwiftUI. 
Complex features were implemented: Authentication, Authorization, Security, Error Handling, Data Modeling, Back-End Arquitecture and many more. 📲 

Please feel free to explre my code in Swift. 
Hope you have fun 🌱
